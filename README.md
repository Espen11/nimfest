# NimFest

NimFest is a web based manifest and jumper registration application written in rails. It is similar to [JumpRun](http://proskydiving.com/jumprun),[RealDropZone](http://www.realdropzone.com/) and [DZ-Manager](http://www.dz-manager.com/) but much simpler. It might also be a bit skewed towards Norwegian skydiving rules as the developers are from Norway.


## Installation

A detailed guide on how to setup in production environments will come. For development/testing purposes, a standard rails setup will suffice.
